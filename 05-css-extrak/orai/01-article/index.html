    <h2>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h2>
    <p>
      Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, often simply shortened to Hogwarts, is a magical school in Hogwarts Legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's located in the Scottish Highlands and resides within Hogwarts Castle, which houses both classrooms and dormitories for its students and staff. Its students are divided into 4 Houses and students are generally accepted in when they're 11 years old, starting as first-years, though a few exceptions have been made for transfer students to start at Hogwarts at a later time in their education, like that of Percival Rackham, Isidora Morganach, and Natsai Onai.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late 19th century, Phineas Nigellus Black was Headmaster, with Matilda Weasley serving as Deputy Headmistress but in reality doing most of Black's duties for him.
    </p>

    <h2>Houses</h2>
    <p>
      Houses are different Divisions of Hogwarts to which students are assigned by the Sorting Hat based on their personal traits. Each house has its own common room and dormitories.
    </p>

    <h3>Gryffindor</h3>

      alt="The house badge of Gryffindor">
    <p>
      House Gryffindor was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as <strong>courage, chivalry, nerve and determination</strong>, to be Sorted into his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold and its house point hourglass was filled with rubies. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as <q>Nearly Headless Nick</q>, was the House ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gryffindor motto was <q>Forti Animo Estote</q>, which was displayed on a stained glass window in the common room.
    </p>

    <h3>Slytherin</h3>

      alt="The house badge of Slytherin">
    <p>
      House Slytherin was founded by Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics included <strong>cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it could be a factor when being sorted. Students of any blood status could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emblematic animal of the house was a snake and the house's colours were green and silver. The patron ghost of the house was the Bloody Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slytherin corresponded roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. The colours also corresponded with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey rainwater.
    </p>

    <h3>Hufflepuff</h3>

      alt="The house badge of Hufflepuff">
    <p>
      House Hufflepuff was founded by the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing <strong>hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play</strong> rather than a particular aptitude in its members.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emblematic animal was a badger, and yellow and black were its house colours. The Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented golden wheat, while black was emblematic of fertile soil. The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated strong abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.
    </p>

    <h3>Ravenclaw</h3>

      alt="The house badge of Ravenclaw">
    <p>
      Ravenclaw was founded by Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were characterised by their <strong>intelligence, wit, knowledge, learning, and wisdom</strong>. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colours. The Ravenclaw's House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air, and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue represented the sky and bronze symbolised the eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw points hourglass contained blue sapphires.
