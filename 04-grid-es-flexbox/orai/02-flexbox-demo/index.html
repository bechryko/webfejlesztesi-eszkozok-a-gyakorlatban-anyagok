      <h1>Book recommendation: <span class="book-title">Valley of Giants</span></h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        A fantasy book I recently read that you should DEFINITELY not miss!
      </p>
      <main>
        <p>
          The Valley is a wonderful place. The forests, fields, lakes and cities surrounded by mountain ranges are home to countless humans, giants, dragons, demons and other magical creatures who live in peace in this place steeped in magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least, that is the story of the elders who have fled the wars and bloodshed and seek to live out the remaining years of their lives in the fragile peace of the Valley's most remote corners. But there are very few of them, so in most of the stories the wanderer hears a dark reality, which this time becomes even darker: storm clouds gathering over the Valley, coming with the approach of the Fifth Great War. And the gods have sensed the presence of a mysterious disease, the likes of which they have never seen before; and perhaps by the time action is taken, all will be in the shadow of doom.

          Azelec, a village boy, finds his life turned upside down when the mayor's son, Emeran, introduces new measures to make life difficult for them. He challenges the boy to a duel, but during their fight something happens that changes the lives of both boys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aine is a city girl, the daughter of one of the Valley's greatest witches. She is living her daily life in peace, away from the responsibilities of her father, when one day her life is turned upside down and she loses almost everything she holds dear.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happens to these young people? Will they be able to become the heroes who can stop the shadows and demonic presence that are rampant in the Valley, or will they be consumed by the ruthless magical beasts of this fantasy world?
